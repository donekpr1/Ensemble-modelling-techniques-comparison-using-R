# Ensemble-modelling-techniques-evaluation-using-R
The project proposes the usage of ensemble models on an employee attrition data analysis and predict whether an employee leave or stay based on some factors to prevent the loss of good people as employees are key asset to any company . Hiring new employees will always take more efforts and cost rather than retaining the old ones. The proposed work will use the application of ensemble learning to solve the binary classification problem, rather than focusing on a single classifier algorithm.This implementation will allow any management to create better decision making actions.

Techniques used:
Bagging 
Bootsrapping+Aggregation combines the bagging.
Boosting
Stacking
The HR analytics dataset consists of 35 variables and 1470 observations and is sourced from Kaggle.
